# League-Assistant

Welcome to my personal project! I have been learning java as a hobby using the University of Helsinki MOOC course. Upon finishing the course, I got the idea for a personal project to continue my learning. Thus, League Assistant was born. My overall goal for the application is to allow easy searching and aggregration of the various league of legends stat websites. Version 1.0 will allow the user to search a specific champion and position and choose what website to search from. 

Planned features include 
  Autoimport of team members and opponents during champ select to recommend champ types/rune changes/team comps
  Ability to aggregate all websites together to get an average for a specific data point
  
  
  
  Currently, I am using Jsoup to connect to sites and parse data. JavaFX is being used to develop the GUI.
